# My blog

## adityassrana.github.io\/blog
This blog is made using Jekyll pages, and is being built from a separate github repository. Don't forget to change the \_config.yml file for ensuring that Jekyll builds properly, for ex.

````
baseurl: "/blog"
url: "https://adityassrana.github.io"
````
For this specific blog I also had to change  < base href="https://adityassrana.github.io/blog/" > in blog\\\_includes\head.html

## Jekyll Templates
More templates are available at http://drjekyllthemes.github.io/
In particular I really liked [Lanyon](http://lanyon.getpoole.com/) and [Hyde](https://hyde.getpoole.com/), both based on the [Poole ](https://getpoole.com/) template.
