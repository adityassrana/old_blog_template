# My blog

This blog is made using Jekyll pages, and is being built from a separate github repository. Don't forget to change the \_config.yml file for ensuring that Jekyll builds properly, for ex.

````
baseurl: "/blog"
url: "https://adityassrana.github.io"
````

For this specific blog I also had to change  < base href="https://adityassrana.github.io/blog/" > in blog\\\_includes\head.html
